// declare variables
//create functions

//pseudo code
//when planner is opened, current day is displayed at the top of calendar

//Then upon scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard biz hours

//when timeblocks are viewed for that day, each timebloc is color coded to indicate whether is is in the future

//When I click into timeblock, then i Enter and event

//When I slick the save btn, then the text for that event is saved in loacl stoarge

//When i refresh the page, then the saved events persist (local storage)

//Things to research on jQuery documentation site
// .Each (loop) for class time block - local storage grab
// .siblings
// .parent.attr $(this) selector
// .addClass and .removeClass -

// localstorage.getItem
// localstorage.setItem

//comment can use from jQuery documentation

//event listener on save btns

//.(this) selector for save btns to store key/values entered in local storage

//moment().get/set
