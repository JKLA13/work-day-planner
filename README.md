THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

\*WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

\*WHEN I click into a timeblock

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

\*WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
